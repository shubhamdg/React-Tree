1. I have made a standard project strutctre to understand the project & code 
2. Inside src folder I Have componets & layouts folder
3. Inside components I have card.js & index.js & style.css 
card.js => I have used functional componeent to create card component & use props 
index.js => import card.js
style.css => css for card 

4. App.js => React i have import inside this main component & others required files 

5. data.json => data for obejct is present 
(* point = > Here "companyname": "Private build ltd" so ouput is also based on data.json]
But assignment output is "Cheap housing ltd"]

6. Index.js => Rendering app component
7. Index.css => styling for the body 


Run the appliaction using npm start
